### Homework

**For week 4:** Finish up your photo essay. We will cover each of them and answer any remaining questions in the following class.

**Ongoing:** Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

**Ongoing:** Prepare a short *"Show and Tell"* on the progress of your project. Design a user flow, a site map and wireframe the general interactions. Prepare a few slides (as a PDF or Google Slides) to present in class for a few minutes.  

*Email your critique and presentation links to [me](mailto:rodrigo@lobula.com) by the end of the day before class.*
