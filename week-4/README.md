### Homework

**Ongoing:** Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

**Ongoing:** Prepare a short *"Show and Tell"* on the progress of your project. Each presentation should include one or many user flows (depending on your project), a description of the actions that users/visitors can take, and a few screens showing your visual design direction and the general user interface layout. You will have 10 minutes to present, that way we'll have time for questions and critiques.

*Email your critique and presentation links to [me](mailto:rodrigo@lobula.com) by the end of the day before class.*
