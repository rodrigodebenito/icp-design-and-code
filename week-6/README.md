### Homework for next week

##### Workshop: Interactive Story
Continue working on the HTML/CSS exercise. We will finish it off next week. Upload what you have [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TpVTIG7IP5FU-hGMGojbw_UirL0DmD0T), so we can address questions over email or in class.

##### Final Projects Update
Work on the graphic design and the interface of your project.
Design one to three pages in your project to present in class. You can use placeholder content. You will use these as blueprints for your project. Identify the main "boxes" in these pages. We will revise these in class and think about the HTML architecture behind it. Upload your designs to [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nv0C9j02eJbfv5u4Mlpmvdl366zLWPD2).
