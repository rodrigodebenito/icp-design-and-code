## Description

Design and Code is a project-focused class intended to give students an understanding about digital storytelling and production and how it integrates in wider contexts and online experiences. This is a hands-on class; students should come with solid ideas or work in progress. Additional small projects will be assigned as part of the learning process. Critical thinking, editing and a strong sense of aesthetics applied to digital design will be core abilities developed during this class.

## Grading

Attendance is mandatory and will affect your grade. Punctuality is also important; students who are more than 15 minutes late will be considered absent for that day. Absences will only be excused with a proper official explanation like a letter or document. You will fail the course if you miss more than three classes or assignments.

Evaluation Criteria:

-   Participation in class, attitude and punctuality: 10%
-   Completion of assignments: 40%
-   Midterm Check In: 25%
-   Final Project / Presentation: 25%

Assignment evaluation will be based on:

-   Creativity. Be original and adventurous. Take risks.
-   Technical execution. Polished results and attention to detail will be highly valued.
-   Completion. Meet your milestones. Be realistic about what you can do and the time it will take you.
-   Communication. Convey your ideas and present your project clearly and in an engaging manner.
-   Other factors. Think about project scalability. Incorporate feedback and user critique into your final
    work.
