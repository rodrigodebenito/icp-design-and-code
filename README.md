## Description

Design and Code 3 is a project focused class intended to give students a wider understanding about digital production and how digital experiences integrate in different contexts like Journalism, Art, Education and Business, both online and offline. This is a hands-on class in which students will be required to create their own personal project from scratch using the skills learnt in previous terms. In addition, students will learn about the process of production of medium and large digital projects and increase their ability to design user experiences and interaction flows. Critical thinking, problem solving and a strong sense of aesthetics applied to digital design will be core abilities developed during this class.

## Grading

Attendance is mandatory and will affect your grade. Punctuality is also important; students who are more than 20 minutes late will be considered absent for that day. Absences will only be excused with a proper official explanation like a letter or document. You will fail the course if you miss more than three classes.

Evaluation Criteria:

* Participation in class, attitude and punctuality: 10%
* Completion of assignments: 20%
* Midterm Check In: 20%
* Final Project / Presentation: 50%

Assignment evaluation will be based on:

* Creativity. Be original and adventurous. Take risks.
* Technical execution. Polished results and attention to detail will be highly valued.
* Completion. Meet your milestones. Be realistic about what you can do and the time it will take you.
* Communication. Convey your ideas and present your project clearly and in an engaging manner.
* Other factors. Think about project scalability. Incorporate feedback and user critique into your final
work.
