##### Journeys
Take a look at this page. Play around with it.
You're going to write your own script for a choose-your-own-adventure story.
Consider the following:
- Imagine 10 scenes and how they are going to relate to each other.
- One of them is the starting point.
- Some of them can be endings.
- Scenes don't need to be too descriptive, a single sentence will be enough.
For inspiration:
- Think about a single day (or a moment in your life) and all the decisions you made. Imagine alternative scenarios and create a narrative.
- Think about a building, or a big space with rooms and what you encounter when you go through them.
