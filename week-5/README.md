# Week 5 (May 11)

### Midterm Show and Tell: Student Projects

Students present their progress and a more specific preview covering basic user interface and next milestones.  

### Homework

**Ongoing:** Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

**Ongoing:** Start looking at production strategies to plan the code architecture and possible libraries or services you want to include. Work on basic code and define the visuals of your project.

*Email your critique and presentation links to [me](mailto:rodrigo@lobula.com) by the end of the day before class.*
