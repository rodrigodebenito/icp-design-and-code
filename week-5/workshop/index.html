        <p class="caption-text">Aricia’s pink sippy cup is full of chocolate milk, but her brother Hakim’s cup contains coffee (café com leite). For many Brazilian parents, coffee for kids is a cultural tradition; the taste evokes their own
          earliest memories. Many also believe
          that coffee provides vitamins and antioxidants and that a small milky serving in the morning helps their children concentrate in school. Hakim ‘‘gets more agitated after he drinks it,’’ his father, Reginaldo Aguiar Gomes, admits. ‘‘I can
          feel
          his mood change.’’ But their pediatrician told them that coffee is fine in moderation. Brother and sister are eating ham and cheese as well as pão com manteiga, bread with butter.</p>
