          <p class="caption-text">Aricia’s pink sippy cup is full of chocolate milk, but her brother Hakim’s cup contains coffee (café com leite). For many Brazilian parents, coffee for kids is a cultural tradition; the taste evokes their own earliest memories. Many also believe
            that coffee provides vitamins and antioxidants and that a small milky serving in the morning helps their children concentrate in school. Hakim ‘‘gets more agitated after he drinks it,’’ his father, Reginaldo Aguiar Gomes, admits. ‘‘I can feel
            his mood change.’’ But their pediatrician told them that coffee is fine in moderation. Brother and sister are eating ham and cheese as well as pão com manteiga, bread with butter.</p>

          <p class="caption-head">Birta Gudrun Brynjarsdottir, 3 ½ years old, Reykjavik, Iceland</p>
          <p class="caption-text">Birta’s oatmeal porridge is called hafragrautur, a staple breakfast in Iceland. The oatmeal is cooked in water or milk and often served with brown sugar, maple syrup, butter, fruit or surmjolk (sour milk). Birta also takes a swig of lysi, or
            cod-liver oil. For part of the year, when the sun barely clears Iceland’s horizon, sunlight is a poor source of vitamin D — but the vitamin is plentiful in fish oils. (The word lysi is related to the Icelandic verb lysa, meaning ‘‘illuminate.’’)
            Birta’s mother, Svana Helgadottir, started giving her four children lysi when each was about 6 months, and now all of them gulp it down without complaint. Many day-care centers and preschools in Iceland dispense cod-liver oil as a regular
            part of the morning routine.</p>

          <p class="caption-text">The elaborate Saturday morning spread in front of Doga includes honey and clotted cream, called kaymak, on toasted bread; green and black olives; fried eggs with a spicy sausage called sucuk; butter; hard-boiled eggs; thick grape syrup (pekmez)
            with tahini on top; an assortment of sheep-, goat- and cow-milk cheeses; quince and blackberry jams; pastries and bread; tomatoes, cucumbers, white radishes and other fresh vegetables; kahvaltilik biber salcasi, a paste made of grilled red
            peppers; hazelnut-flavored halvah, the dense dessert; milk and orange juice. While certainly more elaborate than weekday fare, this Gursoy family meal is in keeping with the hodgepodge that is a typical Turkish breakfast.</p>

          <p class="caption-head">Emily Kathumba, 7 years old, Chitedze, Malawi</p>
          <p class="caption-text">Emily lives with her grandmother Ethel on the outskirts of Lilongwe, Malawi’s capital. Because Ethel works in another family’s home — doing cleaning, cooking and child care — her extended family of nine rises before 6 a.m. to eat breakfast together
            before they disperse to work and school. Here, Emily is eating cornmeal porridge called phala with soy and groundnut flour; deep-fried fritters made of cornmeal, onions, garlic and chiles, along with boiled sweet potato and pumpkin; and a
            dark red juice made from dried hibiscus flowers and sugar. (She is fortunate; half of the children in Malawi are chronically malnourished.) When she can, Emily likes to drink sweet black tea in the mornings, a common beverage for Malawian
            children.</p>

          <p class="caption-head">Saki Suzuki, 2 ¾ years old, Tokyo</p>
          <p class="caption-text">The first time Saki ate the fermented soybean dish called natto, she was 7 months old. She promptly vomited. Her mother, Asaka, thinks that perhaps this was because of the smell, which is vaguely suggestive of canned cat food. But in time, the
            gooey beans became Saki’s favorite food and a constant part of her traditional Japanese breakfasts. Also on the menu are white rice, miso soup, kabocha squash simmered in soy sauce and sweet sake (kabocha no nimono), pickled cucumber (Saki’s
            least favorite dish), rolled egg omelet (tamagoyaki) and grilled salmon.</p>
