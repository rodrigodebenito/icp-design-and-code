### Homework

**For week 3:** Expand your photo essay with the new skills acquired during the workshop. Enable breakpoints on your css stylesheets (via media queries). Try adding some javascript logic such as click / scroll / resize events, templates, etc.  

**Ongoing:** Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

**Ongoing:** Prepare a short *"Show and Tell"* on the progress of your project. Collect the materials you plan to include (or a description of them), your goals, vision and inspiration. The more specific you are, the easier it will be to design strategies and identify pitfalls early on. Prepare a few slides (as a PDF or Google Slides) to present in class for a few minutes.  

*Email your critique and presentation links to [me](mailto:rodrigo@lobula.com) by the end of the day before class.*
