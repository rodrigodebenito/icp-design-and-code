      </h3>
      <p>Design and Code 3 is a project focused class intended to give students a wider understanding about digital production and how digital experiences integrate in different contexts like Journalism, Art, Education and Business, both online and offline. This is a hands-on class in which students will be required to create their own personal project from scratch using the skills learnt in previous terms. In addition, students will learn about the process of production of medium and large digital projects and increase their ability to design user experiences and interaction flows. Critical thinking, problem solving and a strong sense of aesthetics applied to digital design will be core abilities developed during this class.</p>
