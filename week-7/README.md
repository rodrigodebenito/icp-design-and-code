Round of presentations / questions about the students final projects.

### Homework

**Ongoing:** Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

**Ongoing:** Class Project: finalize markup and styles to get a full sense of the visual aspects. Add basic logic to preview interaction.
