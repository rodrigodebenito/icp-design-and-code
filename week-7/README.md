# Week 7 (May 24)

### Show and Tell: Student Projects

Students present their progress. Specifically, visual direction and UI elements should be defined by now.

### Workshop: Express Server

Install node and set up a basic express server.

### Homework

###### Critique
Find a digital project for the *"What's out there"* critique section and prepare a brief design and tech review: what you like, what you don't and how you would improve it. The technical overview should concentrate on one or two aspects of the code structure that are new or interesting for you (libraries, syntax, architecture, etc).  

###### For week 8
Refine your design given the feedback given in class, and create a live prototype with code that can be used later on as the base structure for your final project.
